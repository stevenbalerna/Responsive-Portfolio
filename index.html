      <p>
        My Name is Steven Balerna.

        I have been married for over two years to my beautiful wife, Shakira and I have a daughter, Sienna, who is a
        little over four months old.

        In my spare time I enjoy haning out with my family and traveling.

        I have recently started UNCC Coding Boot Camp. I was born in NJ when I was younger but moved to NC over 20 years
        ago.

        I graduated college from UNCC. I am a sports fan of the Lakers, Eagles, and Phillies.
